# How This Project Applies to Product Analytics

This project started as a way to explore how customer reviews, specifically hotel reviews, can be used to build a simple recommendation system using sentiment analysis and textual similarity.

Although the domain is hospitality, the underlying problem is much more general:
→ How can we extract useful signals from user feedback?

That’s a core question in product analytics too.

## Why It’s Relevant for Product Teams

In product environments, we deal with open-ended feedback all the time, from app reviews, survey responses, or support tickets. 

These inputs are full of insight, but they’re often unstructured, noisy, or in multiple languages. The approach in this project—cleaning the text, detecting sentiment, and matching inputs to relevant content—applies directly to 
- **Prioritizing user requests**
- **Personalizing user experiences**
- **Identifying recurring themes or pain points**

## Conceptual Mapping

| Hotel Recommender Task              | Product Use Case Equivalent                         |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Match user query to relevant hotels | Match user needs to relevant features               |
| Extract sentiment from reviews      | Analyze feedback on product experience              |
| Score reviews by similarity         | Rank backlog items by user urgency or volume        |
| Filter out irrelevant language      | Handle multilingual or low-quality feedback         |

In a product setting, this could translate to:
- A prototype for a feedback categorization tool
- A feature request triage model
- A user-facing recommender for help docs, features, or products

## Final Thought

I built this project to learn more about text-based systems—but it naturally led me to think about how product teams could benefit from similar methods. Translating user voice into structured insight is hard, but incredibly valuable and I’d be excited to explore that further in real-world product settings.

Thanks for reading.
